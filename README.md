# TimelineVisualisation
Personal timeline visualisation project by *[@arixpsy](https://github.com/arixpsy)* and *[@bxtsang](https://github.com/bxtsang)*

An application to help visualise timelines for workers, students or anybody with time sensitive projects or tasks. A main timeline can be segmented into periods, and can be branched out into branch timelines running in parallel, representing different projects. Projects can then have sub branches to represent running tasks. Major deadlines or events can also be visualised on the branches or main timelines.
